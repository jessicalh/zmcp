## üìö Skills for Claude Desktop

I've created **2 skill files** for you to add to Claude Desktop:

### Skill 1: Save Articles
**File:** `C:\projects\zmcp\SKILL-ZOTERO.md`

**What it does:**
- Extracts metadata from article URLs
- Generates 2-3 sentence summaries
- Generates 5-10 keyword tags
- Finds and attaches PDFs (if public)
- Saves with complete bibliographic data

**To add:** Copy the entire contents of `SKILL-ZOTERO.md` into Claude Desktop's skill creator

### Skill 2: Save PDB Structures
**File:** `C:\projects\zmcp\SKILL-PDB.md`

**What it does:**
- Fetches protein structures from RCSB PDB
- Extracts citation metadata (authors, title, DOI)
- Downloads PDB coordinate files
- Attaches PDB files with proper MIME type
- Creates notes with experimental details

**To add:** Copy the entire contents of `SKILL-PDB.md` into Claude Desktop's skill creator

---

## üöÄ How to Complete Setup

### Step 1: Add the Skills to Claude Desktop

For each skill file (`SKILL-ZOTERO.md` and `SKILL-PDB.md`):

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Capabilities** (or **Skills**)
3. Click **"Create skill"** or **"Add skill"**
4. **Paste the entire file contents** (including YAML frontmatter)
5. Click **Save**
6. Repeat for the second skill

### Step 2: Restart Claude Desktop

Close and reopen Claude Desktop to load the MCP server.

### Step 3: Test It Works

**Test MCP connection:**
```
"List my Zotero collections"
```
Should show your collections.

**Test Article skill:**
```
"Save this paper to Zotero: https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762"
```

**Test PDB skill:**
```
"Save PDB structure 4HHB to Zotero"
```

## üìñ Usage Examples

### Saving Academic Articles

**You say:** "Find papers on CRISPR gene editing and save them to Zotero"

**Claude will:**
1. Search for CRISPR papers
2. For each paper:
   - Extract metadata (title, authors, DOI, abstract)
   - Generate summary
   - Generate keywords
   - Find PDF if available
   - Call `create_citation`
3. Report: "Saved 5 papers to your Incoming collection"

### Saving PDB Structures

**You say:** "I'm studying hemoglobin, save structures 4HHB and 2HHB to Zotero"

**Claude will:**
1. For each PDB ID:
   - Fetch from RCSB
   - Get citation metadata
   - Download PDB file
   - Call `save_pdb_to_zotero`
2. Report: "Saved 2 hemoglobin structures to your Protein Structures collection with PDB files attached"

### Mixed Workflow

**You say:** "Save the paper about structure 6VSB and also save the structure itself"

**Claude will:**
1. Find the paper about PDB 6VSB
2. Save paper citation (with PDF if available)
3. Save PDB structure 6VSB (with .pdb file)
4. Both properly cited and organized

## üìÇ What's in Your Zotero Now

After running tests, you have:

**Collections:**
- ‚úÖ "Incoming" - Original default collection
- ‚úÖ "Test Collection" - From comprehensive tests
- ‚úÖ "PDB Structures" - From PDB tests

**Items:**
- ‚úÖ 7 squirrel research papers (from initial tests)
- ‚úÖ 1 comprehensive test paper (full metadata test)
- ‚úÖ 2 PDB structures (4HHB hemoglobin, plus test runs)

**All items have:**
- Complete metadata
- Notes with context
- Tags for searchability
- Attachments (PDFs or PDB files)
- Proper citations for papers/presentations

---

## üéØ Your Workflow Now

### For Literature Review:
```
"Find recent papers on [topic] and save to Zotero"
```
Claude extracts, summarizes, tags, and saves with PDFs.

### For Structural Biology:
```
"Save PDB structures related to [protein] to Zotero"
```
Claude fetches structures with files and proper citations.

### For Organization:
```
"Search my Zotero library for papers on [topic]"
```
Claude searches and shows results.

### For Citations:
All items in Zotero can be:
- Exported to BibTeX, RIS, etc.
- Cited in papers using Zotero plugins (Word, LibreOffice)
- Organized into project-specific collections
- Shared with collaborators
