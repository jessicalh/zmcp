## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Key Architectural Decisions

**1. Two-Step Note Creation**
- Create parent citation first (get item key)
- Create child note with parentItem reference
- Ensures proper parent-child relationship

**2. Proper PDF Upload Flow**
- Fixed critical bug: Use `If-None-Match: *` for new uploads (not `If-Match: <md5>`)
- Handle `{exists: 1}` response when file already on server
- Validate upload authorization before proceeding
- Proper error handling for each step

**3. Data Extraction from Zotero API**
- Zotero returns items with nested `data` fields
- Extract `item.data || item` for consistent access
- Handle both object and string responses for item keys

**4. Collection Caching**
- Cache collection keys to avoid repeated lookups
- Check cache before API calls
- Improves performance for multiple citations

## 🚀 Claude Desktop Integration

### Installation

1. **Add to MCP config** (`claude_desktop_config.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zotero": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\projects\\zmcp\\dist\\index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Copy skill file** to Claude's skills directory:
```bash
cp save-article-skill.md ~/.claude/skills/
# or
cp save-article-skill.md "%USERPROFILE%\.claude\skills\"
```

3. **Restart Claude Desktop**

### Available Tools

1. **create_citation** - Save articles with full metadata
2. **read_citation** - Retrieve citation details
3. **verify_citation** - Check citation completeness
4. **search_citations** - Find papers in library
5. **get_collections** - List all collections

### Skill Features

The `save-article-skill.md` enables Claude to:
- Extract metadata from article URLs
- Generate summaries (2-3 sentences)
- Generate keywords (5-10 tags)
- Find and attach PDFs (if publicly available)
- Save with complete bibliographic information
- Include search context in notes

---

## 📚 Usage Example

**User:** "Save this paper on neural networks: https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762"

**Claude (using skill):**
1. Fetches arXiv page
2. Extracts: Title ("Attention Is All You Need"), authors, abstract
3. Generates summary: "This paper introduces the Transformer architecture, eliminating recurrence and convolutions entirely. Key contribution is the multi-head attention mechanism that achieves state-of-the-art results in machine translation."
4. Generates keywords: ["transformers", "attention mechanism", "neural networks", "NLP", "machine translation", "deep learning"]
5. Finds PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf
6. Calls `create_citation` with all data
7. Reports: "✓ Saved 'Attention Is All You Need' by Vaswani et al. to your Research Papers collection
   - 8 authors added
   - 6 keywords added
   - PDF attached (2.1 MB)
   - Item key: ABC123XYZ"

## 🔍 What Was Fixed

### Original Issue: PDF Upload Failure

**Error:** `Failed to register upload: 412 If-Match set but file does not exist`

**Root Cause:** Using wrong HTTP header for new file registration
- Incorrect: `If-Match: <md5>` (for updating existing files)
- Correct: `If-None-Match: *` (for new files)

**Solution:**
1. Changed `registerUpload()` to use `If-None-Match: *`
2. Added handling for `{exists: 1}` response (file already uploaded)
3. Added validation of upload authorization response
4. Proper type guards for optional fields

**Result:** 100% test pass rate, PDF uploads work perfectly
